# Machine learning resources

For a paper discussion group at 8th Light, in order to provide background information for reading the paper chosen for Oct 2019 meeting: [Fernando-Delgado _et al._, 2014, "Do we need hundreds of classifiers to solve real world classification problems?"](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/delgado14a/delgado14a.pdf).

[What is a classifier](https://github.com/hnlee/ml-resources/blob/master/paper-discussion-201910-resources-01.md)

[Measuring machine learning performance](https://github.com/hnlee/ml-resources/blob/master/paper-discussion-201910-resources-02.md)

A whirlwind tour of classifier families
* [Linear models: linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine](https://github.com/hnlee/ml-resources/blob/master/paper-discussion-201910-resources-03.ipynb)
* Variations on linearity: logistic regression, multinomial regression, generalized linear models, multivariate adaptive regression splines
* Branching models: decision trees, rule-based methods
* Ensemble models: boosting, bagging, stacking, random forests
* Neural networks
* Bayesian approaches
* Incorporating unsupervised learning: nearest neighbors, principal component
